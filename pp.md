Pragmatic Programmer
--

## Chapter 1 - Pragmatic Philosophy
1. The cat ate my source code - Bring solutions to problems, take responsibility
   of your work (as well as just being open to taking responsibility), think
   about what you'd think if someone came to you with your excuse - what would
   you say / think?

2. Broken windows - Software naturally decays, leaving a "broken window" in your
   code creates an environment where others are less apt to keep the code
   "nice", much like a neighborhood starts going downhill after the first broken
   window (that doesn't get fixed)

3. Stone soup and boiled frogs - We can convince others to help our projects if
   we just start with something (that we can ourselves manage) and throw out
   ideas on how it might get improved, folks are more likely to contribute if
   there's some groundwork laid and / or they can see some product in action

4. Good enough software - Be wary of trying to get software perfect, instead
   just try to get something "good enough" out there so people can start using
   it and you can really determine where it works, is broken, etc.  Perfect is
   the enemy of the good!

5. Knowledge investment - Treat knowledge like an investment, you must always be
   putting into it to reap benefits, monitor where the investments are going,
   take some safe investments and balance them with risky (i.e. stable tech
   versus new fancy tech)

6. Communicate
